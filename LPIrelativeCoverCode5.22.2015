#### Not sure why this part is'nt working #####
#### Took the file below (which is the same as above without 'Common')
#### and used SUM and COUNTIF in Excel to find the colum sums and 
#### number of sites each veg was found at
#### then I manually removed those with COUNTIF below 5 AND SUMS below .05 (had to both be below to be removed)

###Determines which species are common
#threshold = 0.001

#CommonRelCover = relcover[ ,which(colSums(relcover > 0) > threshold * 99 )]
#CommonRelCover
#write.csv(CommonRelCover,file="F:/LPICommonRelativeCover.csv")
###I added the header name 'Plot to col 1'
###I also added 2 more col where I split soil and veg and named them accordingly
